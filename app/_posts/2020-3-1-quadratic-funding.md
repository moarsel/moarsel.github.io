## Background

[OpenFund](https://github.com/moarsel/openfund) was my winning submission to the [GitxChange hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/issue/RadicalxChange/GitxChange/5/100023819). It demonstrates how Quadratic Funding (in fiat) can be made as intuitive and perhaps even more compelling than traditional fundraising platforms like Kickstarter or GoFundMe.

# OpenFund

My concept for OpenFund was to take the hackathon challenge and use a modern JAMstack architecture to build a simple, compelling MVP of a Quadratic funding platform. It shows how the financial features needed for better funding of public goods can be quickly built on the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) platform).

As part of the challenge of making the application approachable and intuitive, I wanted to build a simple design language that fit the RadicalExchange aesthetic but that also worked in less editorial, more interactive application. To accomplish this I put together a moodboard and then customized a Tailwind CSS Figma library and built a mini component library with React + Tailwind.

## Next steps

The resulting code from the hackathon is open source, and any organization that wants a quadratic funding platform can take this and run with it. The next step is to put it in front of real people and battle test it before it goes live.
