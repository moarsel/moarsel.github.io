Here is the code for my portfolio, hosted on russellhoy.com using github pages and jekyll.

I used this great [yeoman generator](https://github.com/centresource/generator-playbook) to get quickly set up with:

- Bourbon (helpful sass mixins)
- Neat (lightweight semantic grid)
- Refills (great base components for clean css)
- Grunt tasks (for js linting, css linting, tests, asset preparation, and deployment)

Then I just built out the homepage, set up some styling for posts, and finished. 
I highly recommend playbook for front end devs to quickly get going with github pages.
