Since we were all unfamiliar with the field, we decided to carry out an extensive design research phase before building anything.</p><p>Since this is purely a volunteer based project, the first thing we had to decide was the scope of our work, and where our interests lay. We wanted to build something that would last beyond the current media hype, and that would help refugee sponsors rather than the refugees directly. Since none of us are primarily designers/strategists, we also wanted to try out different research methodologies.</p><p>The question we were trying to answer was:</p><h2>How can we empower sponsors to improve the lives of newcomers to Canada?</h2><p>We started by going to information sessions and interviewing experts in the field to understand what was going on. I wrote out an interview guide which we then used to interview several sponsors and understand their stories: what motivates them, and how they work cooperatively on such a sensitive and difficult topic.</p><p>After clustering our notes and extracting the themes of our research, we wrote out insights ideated around possible solutions. Examples of our findings included:</p><h3>&quot;People need to know the status of their application and get frustrated with the lack of transparency.&quot;</h3><h3>A disabling fear of failure can stem from working with a new group of people</h3><p>As a team we began brainstorming solutions to these problems. We started with a blue sky, &quot;anything goes&quot; approach, and gradually moved to more concrete ideas that we could prototype. As a team, we settled on the idea of a community driven progress bar where users can see their sponsorship progress and see how the community is progressing as well. The idea originally came from the insight that adding a progress bar to a website can increase conversion rate when users see how far they&#39;ve come.</p><p>Here&#39;s a mockup I made of what the dashboard interface could look like:</p><p><img src=/images/67f2.sponsorship-momentum.png width=50%></p><p>The project is still ongoing and we&#39;re hoping to test out some of these concepts to see how sponsors react to them!</p></article></div><footer class=message-footer><h2>It would be great to work together!
