Our project team of designers, developers, and a strategist dived right in to understand their business, interview their customers, and build working prototypes to validate solutions for the next generation of their platform.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/hidden-dh-content.png class=feature-image alt="hidden app preview"></p><p>We all worked closely with several of D+Hs product managers to research the customer&#39;s experience, and then build and validate solutions in order to iterate as quickly possible. In addition to conducting interviews, and collaborating on the design, I implemented several functional prototypes with Angular.js and a brandable modification of Google&#39;s material design system. Our technical set up enabled me to iterate the product as quickly as the design evolved. This lean set up gave us a very fast feedback loop, enabling us to build and deploy UI changes in between user interviews.</p><h2>Research Methodology</h2><p>Using the <a href="https://jtbd.info/">Jobs-To-Be-Done</a> methodology, we interviewed several potential users in order to really dig into the customers perspective. This research helped us understand how we could solve <em>real</em> user problems and develop very clear requirements to drive the direction of the platform.</p><p>After our initial research stage, we built out and iterated upon a prioritized list of interface components and user flows. We then looped back and tested our original hypotheses through several usability tests and stakeholder interviews. This discovery (and re-discovery) process helped define the capabilities that D+H should invest in, while minimizing the risk involved in launching such a cutting edge initiative.</p><p>For an overview of the project you can read <a href="https://www.architech.ca/portfolio/financial-technology-provider/">this article</a>, or get in touch to learn more!</p></article></div><footer class=message-footer><h2>It would be great to work together!
