Since we were all unfamiliar with the field, we decided to carry out extensive design research phase before building anything.</p><p>Since this is purely a volunteer based project, the first thing we had to decide was the scope of our work, and where our interests lay. We wanted to build something that would last beyond the current media hype, and that would help refugee sponsors rather than the refugees directly.</p><p>Our basic process was to start by interviewing experts in the field to understand what was going, then talk to sponsors and find out their pain points. After synthesizing these pain points into insights, we ideated around possible solutions and began building a solution with the intention of testing our assumptions and validating our ideas.</p><p>The project is still ongoing, but you can read a summary of what we&#39;ve done so far on the <a href=http://blog2.architech.ca/h/i/218387214-architechs-newly-minted-civic-hackers-plan-to-keep-up-the-great-work>Architech blog</a>.</p></article></div><footer class=message-footer><h2>It would be great to work together!
