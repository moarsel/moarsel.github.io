Our authors have written over 220,000 storybooks and we're learning a ton!</p><div class=cta-containers><a href="/" class=primary-btn><i class="fa fa-home"></i> Home</a> <a href="mailto:russell.hoy@gmail.com?sqs_title=Drop+me+a+line" class=primary-btn><i class="fa fa-send"></i> Message Me</a></div></div></header><div class=article-wrapper><article><h1>The Idea</h1><p><a href=https://www.mystorybook.com>MyStorybook.com</a> is a platform for making and printing children&#39;s storybooks. In 2014, my partner and I set out to create a tool that was simple enough for kids and teachers to use and enjoy.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/7476.mystorybook-lg.jpg class=feature-image width=100% alt="my storybook preview"></p><p>Between the design, full stack development, and marketing strategy, it was a pretty huge undertaking. Since we launched, our community has grown to over 130,000 users and 220,000 storybooks. We were given the award for “<a href=http://www.ala.org/aasl/standards/best/websites/2015>best website for teaching and learning</a>” in 2015 from the American Association of School Librarians.</p><p><img src=/images/posts/ca17.mystorybook-lesson-modal.png class=feature-image alt="my storybook preview"></p><h2>A Tour of MyStorybook.com</h2><p>When you go to <a href="https://www.mystorybook.com/books/new/"><em>My Storybook</em></a>, you can start a new book right away without signing up, then add custom characters, images, text, and drawings. Although we have some cleaner designs that haven&#39;t been built out, we&#39;ve iterated the design a couple times and have achieved a good conversion rate for new users, combined with a high average of time spent writing stories.</p><p>Our goal was to make a useful tool for children to explore storytelling in their own way. My Storybook is really a blank canvas for creativity, and although we&#39;d like to scaffold the process of writing a story, the primary goal of the site was to let teachers and students guide their own learning.</p><h2>The Tech Stack</h2><p>I started by building my own HTML5 canvas javascript library for editing stories, but quickly discovered that <a href=https://twitter.com/kangax>Kangax</a> had built a more robust, fully featured canvas editing library that already did 80% of what I needed. When I started the concept, front end frameworks were not as widely adopted and vanilla javascript + jQuery seemed like the most obvious choice for building the site, but in retrospect I&#39;ve looked into refactoring the front end using a javascript framework to enable quicker development and more delightful interactions.</p><p>Using Ruby on Rails along with with Heroku&#39;s PAAS hosting was definitely a good decision, since it is relatively easy (and FAST) to get up and running with user authentication, administrative capabilities, Stripe for payment processing, etc.</p><h3>Marketing &amp; SEO</h3><p>Despite not spending nearly as much time as I would have liked to so far on the digital marketing side of things, the site was architected with SEO in mind, and we rank for all the search terms that we targetted in our initial keyword research. We outrank certain competitors on many keywords, and we&#39;re climbing the rankings on search terms like &quot;make books online&quot;, &quot;Storybooks&quot;, etc. Our inbound traffic have been growing consistently causing our servers to stutter under heavy use -- but as a side project I see this a good problem to have!</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>The education technology community has been very positive, and many schools around the world are really enthusiastic about the site. Ed Tech industry leaders such as <a href=https://twitter.com/Larryferlazzo>Larry Ferlazzo</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/rmbyrne>Richard Byrne</a> reviewed the app <a href="http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2014/09/09/my-storybook-is-a-new-free-good-site-for-students-to-write-online/">here</a> and <a href=http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2014/09/mystorybook-good-platform-for-creating.html>here</a>.</p><h2>My Storybook 2.0?</h2><p>As the site continued to grow, uploading and downloading large books for several full classrooms at once began to be expensive and hard to maintain on Heroku. My friend and colleague <a href="http://harneksidhu.com/">Harnek Sidhu</a> put in a big effort to migrate the Rails back end to Digital Ocean, using Docker and Ansible to make it easy to switch hosting providers and support more complex configurations.</p><p>In my free time I&#39;ve taken a step back and started redesigning the site from the ground up with a new strategy based on the state of the edtech industry, our metrics, and the research we gathered. In particular, we&#39;re solving some problems around long term user retention, classroom integration, and some usability issues stemming from the site&#39;s architecture.</p><p><img class=feature-image src=/images/f6bc.mystorybook-preview.png width=50%></p><p>Although MyStorybook.com is still profitable and growing, it is in maintenance mode, with my partner and co-founder supporting the site and managing the community. There&#39;s always more to do, but it felt great to launch a large website with such positive outcomes. If you&#39;d like to learn more about the redesigned My Storybook, I&#39;d love to chat!</p></article></div><footer class=message-footer><h2>It would be great to work together!
