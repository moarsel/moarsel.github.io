Our authors have written over 200,000 storybooks and we're learning a ton!</p><div class=cta-containers><a href="/" class=secondary-btn><i class="fa fa-home"></i> Home</a> <a href="mailto:russell.hoy@gmail.com?sqs_title=Drop+me+a+line" class=primary-btn><i class="fa fa-send"></i> Message Me</a></div></div></header><div class=article-wrapper><article><h1>The Idea</h1><p><a href=https://www.mystorybook.com>MyStorybook.com</a> is a platform for making and printing children&#39;s storybooks. In 2014 I set out to create a tool that was simple enough for kids and teachers to use and enjoy.</p><p>Between the design, front end development, back end development and marketing strategy, it was a pretty huge undertaking for a solo developer. Since we launched, our community has grown to over 120,000 total users and 200,000 storybooks. We were given the award for “<a href=http://www.ala.org/aasl/standards/best/websites/2015>best website for teaching and learning</a>” for 2015 from the American Association of School Librarians.</p><h2>A Tour of MyStorybook.com</h2><p>I wanted the onboarding process for new users to be as easy and enticing as possible. By now we&#39;ve iterated the design a couple times and have achieved a fairly low bounce rate for new users, and the average users spend several minutes writing their stories.</p><p>When you go to <a href="https://www.mystorybook.com/books/new/"><em>My Storybook</em></a>, you can start a new book right away without signing up, then add custom characters, images, text, and drawings.</p><h4>Gamifying children&#39;s apps</h4><p>We could have &quot;gamified&quot; the storywriting process more, and it would probably improve our conversion rate, but at the end of the day we cared more about making a useful tool for children to explore storytelling in their own way. Overly gamified children&#39;s apps like Candy Crush might be fun for a while but they go against the philosophy of letting children guide their own learning.</p><p>Since our audience includes teachers, parents, and students, it is important for us to gain their trust by being open and straightforward with issues like gamification, privacy, and safety.</p><h2>The Tech Stack</h2><p>I started by building my own HTML5 canvas library for editing stories, but quickly discovered that <a href=https://twitter.com/kangax>Kangax</a> had built a more robust, fully featured canvas library that already did 80% of what I needed. When I started, jQuery seemed the most obvious choice of javascript library, but several months later, I&#39;ve looked into refactoring the front end using a javascript framework to enable quicker development and more delightful interactions.</p><p>Using Ruby on Rails with Heroku&#39;s &quot;plug and play&quot; hosting for the back end was definitely a good decision, since it is relatively easy to get up and running with user authentication, administrative capabilities, Stripe for payment processing, etc.</p><h2>The Tech Stack 2.0</h2><p>As the site continued to grow however, uploading and downloading books for several full classrooms at once began to be expensive and harder to maintain. My friend and colleague <a href="http://harneksidhu.com/">Harnek Sidhu</a> put in a big effort to migrate the back end to Digital Ocean, using Docker and Ansible to make it easy to switch hosting providers and support more complex configurations.</p><p>In my free time I&#39;ve redesigned the site from the ground up with a new marketing strategy and business model in mind, but whether I have time to rebuild it is another question!</p><p><img src=/images/f6bc.mystorybook-preview.png width=50%></p><h3>Marketing &amp; SEO</h3><p>Despite not spending nearly as much time as I would have liked to so far on marketing and SEO, the site architecture was built with SEO in mind, and we are beginning to rank for all the search terms that we targetted in our initial keyword research. We outrank certain competitors on many keywords, and we&#39;re climbing the rankings on search terms like &quot;make books online&quot;, &quot;Storybooks&quot;, etc. Traffic is continually growing, causing our servers to stutter under heavy use -- a good problem to have!</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>The education technology community has been very positive, and many schools around the world are really enthusiastic about the site. Ed Tech industry leaders such as <a href=https://twitter.com/Larryferlazzo>Larry Ferlazzo</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/rmbyrne>Richard Byrne</a> reviewed the app <a href="http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2014/09/09/my-storybook-is-a-new-free-good-site-for-students-to-write-online/">here</a> and <a href=http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2014/09/mystorybook-good-platform-for-creating.html>here</a>.</p><p>There&#39;s always more to do, but it feels great to launch a big website and get a positive reaction! I&#39;ve learned a ton about development, design, lean startup methodology, business model design, and education technology.</p><p>MyStorybook.com is mostly in maintenance mode, with my wife and co-founder taking over the marketing and community management.</p></article></div><footer class=message-footer><h2>It would be great to work together!
